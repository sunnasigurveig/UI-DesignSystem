<h3> Colours </h3>

Blue is a soothing color, helping calm the mind and aid concentration. Blue is brilliant for completing administrative tasks or projects that require maximum focus. Add a splash of orange if you need extra inspiration.

Orange calls to mind feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, and warmth. Orange is often used to draw attention, such as in traffic signs and advertising.

Gray is the color of intellect and of compromise. It's a diplomatic color, negotiating all the distance between black and white. We typically consider gray to be conservative, elegant, and cool
